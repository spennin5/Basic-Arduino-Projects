This is a simplified and slightly modified version of code used by jsvester of www.instructables.com. 

This project uses the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. This works by sending out 8 inaudible pulses and listening for their echo.
This data is then converted to centimeters and displayed on the serial monitor. 

Pinouts: 
  -Vcc ---> 5V
  -Gnd ---> Gnd
  -Echo ---> D8
  -Trig ---> D9
